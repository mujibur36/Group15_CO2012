My contributions
•	I've made a 'Worksheet 1' live link for everyone to view and work together! To see what might need editing, what's wrong with which sections etc...

I have disscussed with group before makeing any changes:

•	I have added created a table of content
•	Added required features to make it work correctly
•	Added page number

Let me know if you would like me to remove it!

Some of the changes I have made so far in deliverable 1:
•	I’ve changed the heading
•	The designs of the table
•	Layout of the page
•	Changed some features
•	Reworded few of my sections

•	I would like for us to go through deliverable 1 texts and find whatever needs to be fixed

•	I would like for us to go through deliverable 2 and fix whatever needs to be fixed


Add suggestions
•	State that we conducted our survey in person (through one to one questioning)
•	Can I change headings of the survey to (Question 1, Question 2, Question 3, etc)

* I have redesigned the survey layout
* I have added a new section ‘Survey Questions’ (“You should submit 1. A copy of the survey that was completed.”)
